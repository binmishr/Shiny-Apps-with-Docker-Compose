# Shiny-Apps-with-Docker-Compose
Development Details

 Use Docker Compose to simplify Shiny app deployment and reach dev/prod parity. Part 1 looks at local development.

This post picks up where we left off with hosting Shiny apps with Docker run and Caddy server. There were a few shortcomings with that very basic setup: the home page looked very blunt, and managing updates to the apps was not at all streamlined.

In this post, you will learn how to use Docker Compose to simplify the management of deploying and updating multiple Shiny apps and a proxy server. We will also spend some time making the home page prettier using the Bulma CSS and the Vue JavaScript library.

The codeset is attached in the .docx file in this repository.
